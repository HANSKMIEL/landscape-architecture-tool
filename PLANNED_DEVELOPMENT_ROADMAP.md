## Testing Instructions

### Running the Development Log System
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Python dependencies are installed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Update Development Log**: Use the automated logging script
   ```bash
   python scripts/update_dev_log.py --action "feature_added" --description "New plant recommendation algorithm" --author "developer_name"
   ```

3. **Available Log Actions**:
   - `feature_added`: Log new feature implementations
   - `bug_fixed`: Record bug fixes
   - `refactor`: Document code refactoring
   - `test_added`: Track new test additions
   - `docs_updated`: Log documentation updates

4. **View Development Log**:
   ```bash
   cat dev_log.md
   ```

### Testing the Core Application
1. **Run Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```

2. **Manual API Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Start the application
   python -m src.main
   
   # Test health endpoint
   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   
   # Test API documentation
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/
   ```

3. **Database Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test database initialization
   python -c "from src.utils.db_init import initialize_database; initialize_database()"
   ```

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Development log updates correctly with proper formatting
- [ ] Log entries include timestamp, action, description, and author
- [ ] Log file is created in the project root directory
- [ ] Script handles various input parameters correctly
- [ ] Error handling works for invalid inputs
- [ ] Log format is consistent and readable
- [ ] Integration with existing project structure

## Development Log Management

### Log Entry Format
Each development log entry follows this format:
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - ACTION_TYPE
**Author**: Developer Name
**Description**: Detailed description of changes
**Impact**: Brief impact assessment

---
```

### Log Categories
- **FEATURE_ADDED**: New functionality implementation
- **BUG_FIXED**: Bug resolution and fixes
- **REFACTOR**: Code structure improvements
- **TEST_ADDED**: Test coverage enhancements
- **DOCS_UPDATED**: Documentation modifications
- **CONFIG_CHANGED**: Configuration updates

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
- All pull requests trigger automated test suite
- Code quality checks with linting and formatting
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Database migration testing

### Development Workflow
1. Feature development in branches
2. Automated testing on pull requests
3. Code review process
4. Development log updates
5. Merge to main branch
6. Deployment to staging environment

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Development Metrics
- Development velocity tracking
- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage monitoring
- Bug resolution time tracking

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly security audits
- Quarterly performance reviews
- Annual architecture assessments
