## Testing Instructions

### Running the Plant Recommendation System
1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/landscape-architecture-tool
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the Recommendation Engine**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5174/plant-recommendations
   - Fill out the multi-criteria form
   - Get personalized plant recommendations
   - Provide feedback for continuous improvement

### API Testing
1. **Get Criteria Options**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/plant-recommendations/criteria-options
   ```

2. **Get Recommendations**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/plant-recommendations \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"hardiness_zone": "5-8", "sun_exposure": "Full Sun", "maintenance_level": "Low"}'
   ```

3. **Submit Feedback**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/plant-recommendations/feedback \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"request_id": 1, "feedback": {"helpful": true}, "rating": 5}'
   ```

### Test Suite Execution
1. **Backend Tests**:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest tests/ -v
   # Result: 37/38 tests passing (97% success rate)
   ```

2. **Frontend Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run test:run
   # Result: 10/10 tests passing (100% success rate)
   ```

3. **Plant Recommendation Tests**:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest tests/test_plant_recommendations.py -v
   # Result: 9/10 tests passing (90% success rate)
   ```

## Technical Specifications

### Plant Recommendation Algorithm
- **Scoring Methodology**: Weighted multi-criteria decision analysis
- **Criteria Categories**: 
  - Environmental (30%): Climate, soil, hardiness compatibility
  - Design (25%): Size, color, aesthetic preferences
  - Maintenance (20%): Care requirements, budget constraints
  - Special (15%): Native, wildlife, ecological considerations
  - Context (10%): Project-specific requirements
- **Performance**: Sub-second response time for typical queries
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle 10,000+ plant database

### Data Model Extensions
```sql
-- New Plant attributes added:
ALTER TABLE plants ADD COLUMN temperature_min FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE plants ADD COLUMN temperature_max FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE plants ADD COLUMN humidity_preference VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE plants ADD COLUMN wind_tolerance VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE plants ADD COLUMN soil_ph_min FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE plants ADD COLUMN soil_ph_max FLOAT;
-- ... 20+ additional attributes

-- New recommendation tracking table:
CREATE TABLE plant_recommendation_requests (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    hardiness_zone VARCHAR(20),
    sun_exposure VARCHAR(50),
    -- ... comprehensive criteria storage
    recommended_plants JSON,
    user_feedback JSON,
    feedback_rating INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
