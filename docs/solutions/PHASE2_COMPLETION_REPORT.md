## 🔐 Security Improvements

### .gitignore Updates
```gitignore
# Manus temporary handoff files
.manus/
```

**Rationale**: 
- `.manus/` contains temporary handoff files, reports, and context
- Should not be tracked in git repository
- Reduces repository size and clutter
- No security risks, just organizational improvement

---

## 🎓 Documentation Index Created

**New File**: `docs/README.md`

Provides centralized navigation with sections:
- 📚 Documentation Structure
- 🚀 Getting Started
- 🏗️ Architecture & Design
- 📖 Development
- 🚢 Deployment
- 📝 Planning & Roadmaps
- 💡 Solutions & Fixes
- 📘 Guides

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single entry point for all documentation
- ✅ Clear categorization by purpose
- ✅ Direct links to most important docs
- ✅ Easier onboarding for new developers
- ✅ Better for external integration documentation

---

## 🧪 Validation Performed

### Pre-Consolidation Checks
```bash
# Counted files before consolidation
docs/: 27 markdown files
_internal/docs/: 71 markdown files
_internal/documentation/: 12 markdown files
archive/packages/: 6.2MB (v1.00: 3.1MB, v1.00D: 3.1MB)
```

### Post-Consolidation Checks
```bash
# Verified structure after consolidation
docs/: 90 markdown files
_internal/: 1.4MB (mostly operations/)
archive/packages/: 1.1MB (2 tar.gz archives)

# Verified git tracking
git status: All changes tracked
git commit: 531 files changed
git push: Successfully pushed to V1.00D
```

### Archive Compression Validation
```bash
$ ls -lh archive/packages/*.tar.gz
archive/packages/v1.00-archived.tar.gz   511K
archive/packages/v1.00D-archived.tar.gz  511K

# Compression ratio: 3.1MB → 511KB = 83.5% reduction per archive
```
