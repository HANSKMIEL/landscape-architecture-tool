## 🤔 Part 2: What I Need to Ask You

These are the questions I need answers to in order to help you most effectively:

### Business and Market Questions

**1. Who are your customers?**

- What size projects do you typically work on?
- What's your geographic market (Netherlands, Europe, global)?

**2. What's your primary business goal?**
- Do you want to use this internally for your own projects?
- Do you want to sell it as software to other landscape architects?
- Is this a service you provide to clients (they use your tool)?

**3. What's your timeline and pressure?**
- Do you need something working in weeks, months, or can we take time to do it right?
- Are there specific deadlines (client demos, business needs)?
- What would "success" look like in 3 months vs 1 year?

### Technical and Resource Questions

**4. What's your technical comfort level?**
- Are you comfortable running command-line tools?
- Do you want to learn to make changes yourself, or prefer I handle everything?
- What's your preferred way to receive updates (GitHub, email, video calls)?

**5. What are your hosting and budget constraints?**
- Do you have a budget for cloud hosting (~€20-50/month initially)?
- Are you comfortable with services like DigitalOcean, Heroku, or AWS?
- Do you need this to run locally or be accessible from anywhere?

**6. What data do you already have?**
- Do you have existing plant databases, client lists, or project data?
- What format is this data in (Excel, other software, paper)?
- How important is migrating existing data vs starting fresh?

### Feature Priority Questions

**7. What features are most important for your immediate success?**
- What would make this valuable enough that you'd use it for real projects?
- What would convince a client to choose you over competitors?
- What manual work are you most tired of doing?

**8. What integrations matter to you?**
- Do you use specific design software (CAD, SketchUp, etc.)?
- Do you need to connect to suppliers' systems for pricing?
- Are there industry-standard tools your clients expect?
