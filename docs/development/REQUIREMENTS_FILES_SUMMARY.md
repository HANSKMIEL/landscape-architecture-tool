## 🎯 Usage Guide

### For Different User Types:

| User Type | File to Use | Command |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Developer** | `requirements-dev.txt` | `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` |
| **Production** | `requirements.txt` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| **CI/CD** | `requirements-dev.txt` | Used in GitHub Actions |
| **End User** | Docker/Codespaces | Handled automatically |
| **Copilot** | `requirements-dev.txt` | For development assistance |

## 🧪 Functionality Testing Results

### ✅ All Tests Passed:

1. **File Existence**: All 4 core files exist and are readable
2. **Import Testing**: Core dependencies (Flask, SQLAlchemy, Redis, Pydantic) import successfully  
3. **Compile Script**: `./scripts/compile_requirements.sh` works with timeout handling and retry logic
4. **CI Integration**: Files are properly referenced in GitHub Actions workflows
5. **Documentation**: All references updated to reflect current structure

### 📊 Dependency Analysis:

- **Production (`requirements.txt`)**: 75+ packages including Flask, database drivers, production servers
- **Development (`requirements-dev.txt`)**: 162+ packages including all production dependencies plus testing, linting, security tools

## 🔄 Dependency Management Workflow

1. **Edit source files**: Modify `requirements.in` or `requirements-dev.in`
2. **Compile changes**: Run `./scripts/compile_requirements.sh <file.in>`
3. **Commit both**: Always commit both .in and .txt files together
4. **Test**: Verify functionality in development and CI environments

## 📚 Documentation Created

- **`REQUIREMENTS_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide (6,000+ characters)
- **Updated `README.md`** - Reflects current file structure
- **This summary** - Quick reference for all stakeholders

## ✅ Final Status

The requirements files are now **clean, documented, and fully functional** for:
- ✅ Developers using the full development stack
- ✅ Production deployments with minimal dependencies  
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines with comprehensive testing tools
- ✅ End users via Docker/Codespaces (automatic)
- ✅ GitHub Copilot development assistance

All deprecated files have been removed, documentation is comprehensive, and the pip-compile workflow is tested and working.

---

**Result**: The requirements files structure is now optimized, well-documented, and ready for all use cases across the landscape architecture tool project.
