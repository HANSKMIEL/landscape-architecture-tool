### Quick Start (One Command)

```bash
ssh root@72.60.176.200 "bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HANSKMIEL/landscape-architecture-tool/V1.00D/scripts/vps_clean_reinstall.sh)"
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **SSH into VPS**:
   ```bash
   ssh root@72.60.176.200
   ```

2. **Download and run clean reinstall script**:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HANSKMIEL/landscape-architecture-tool/V1.00D/scripts/vps_clean_reinstall.sh
   chmod +x vps_clean_reinstall.sh
   sudo ./vps_clean_reinstall.sh
   ```

3. **Run testing script to verify**:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HANSKMIEL/landscape-architecture-tool/V1.00D/scripts/vps_deployment_test.sh
   chmod +x vps_deployment_test.sh
   ./vps_deployment_test.sh
   ```

## 📋 Installation Steps Performed

The clean reinstall script executes these steps automatically:

1. **Create Backup** - Full backup of existing installation to `/var/backups/landscape-architecture-tool/`
2. **Stop Services** - Gracefully stops all running services
3. **Delete Old Installation** - Removes old application directory (after backup)
4. **Clone Repository** - Fresh clone from V1.00D branch
5. **Restore Configuration** - Restores .env file from backup
6. **Setup Python Environment** - Creates venv and installs dependencies
7. **Initialize Database** - Restores database from backup or prepares fresh DB
8. **Setup Frontend** - Installs npm packages and builds frontend
9. **Setup Systemd Service** - Creates/updates service configuration
10. **Set Permissions** - Configures proper file ownership and permissions
11. **Start Services** - Starts and enables backend service
12. **Verify Installation** - Comprehensive verification of deployment

## ✅ Testing & Verification

### Automated Testing
Run the deployment test script:
```bash
./scripts/vps_deployment_test.sh
```

### Manual Verification

1. **Check Service Status**:
   ```bash
   systemctl status landscape-backend
   ```

2. **Test Health Endpoint (Internal)**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   ```

3. **Test Health Endpoint (External)**:
   ```bash
   curl http://72.60.176.200:8080/health
   ```

4. **View Application in Browser**:
   - Navigate to: http://72.60.176.200:8080/

5. **Monitor Logs**:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u landscape-backend -f
   ```

### Expected Results

✅ Service running: `systemctl status landscape-backend` shows "active (running)"  
✅ Health endpoint: Returns JSON with status and version  
✅ Frontend loads: Application displays in browser  
✅ API endpoints: `/api/suppliers`, `/api/plants`, etc. respond correctly  
✅ No errors: Logs show normal operation  

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
journalctl -u landscape-backend -n 50

# Reinstall dependencies
source /var/www/landscape-architecture-tool/venv/bin/activate
pip install -r /var/www/landscape-architecture-tool/requirements.txt

# Restart service
systemctl restart landscape-backend
```

### Health Endpoint Not Responding
```bash
# Check if port is listening
netstat -tlnp | grep 5000

# Restart service
systemctl restart landscape-backend

# Check for errors
journalctl -u landscape-backend -n 100
```

### Frontend Not Loading
```bash
# Rebuild frontend
cd /var/www/landscape-architecture-tool/frontend
npm ci
npm run build

# Restart service
systemctl restart landscape-backend
```

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

If the new installation has issues:

```bash
# Stop service
systemctl stop landscape-backend

# Find latest backup
ls -lt /var/backups/landscape-architecture-tool/

# Restore (replace TIMESTAMP with actual)
cd /var/www
rm -rf landscape-architecture-tool
tar -xzf /var/backups/landscape-architecture-tool/backup_TIMESTAMP/app_backup.tar.gz

# Start service
systemctl start landscape-backend
```

```

### Monitoring

Monitor the service continuously:
```bash
# Real-time logs
journalctl -u landscape-backend -f

# Service status check
watch -n 5 systemctl status landscape-backend

# Health endpoint monitoring
watch -n 10 'curl -s http://localhost:5000/health | jq'
```
