# Landscape Architecture Tool - Developer Instructions

**ALWAYS follow these instructions first.** Only search for additional information or run exploratory bash commands if the information provided here is incomplete or found to be in error.

The Landscape Architecture Tool is a Python Flask backend with React/Vite frontend for managing landscape architecture projects, suppliers, plants, products, and clients.

## CRITICAL: Build and Test Timeouts

**NEVER CANCEL any build or test command.** Always use proper timeouts:

- **Backend tests**: 120 seconds (takes ~50 seconds) 
- **Frontend build**: 180 seconds (takes ~7 seconds) 
- **Frontend tests**: 60 seconds (takes ~8 seconds with some known failures)
- **Docker build**: 300+ seconds (CURRENTLY FAILS - Dockerfile syntax error)
- **Full test suite**: 240 seconds (takes ~58 seconds with mixed results)
- **pip install**: 600 seconds (takes ~1.7 minutes)

## Bootstrap and Build Process

### Initial Setup Commands
Run these commands in order when working with a fresh clone:

```bash
# 1. Install all dependencies (takes ~1.5 minutes)
make install

# 2. Build both backend and frontend (takes ~23 seconds)
make build

# 3. Run backend tests to validate setup (takes ~50 seconds)
make backend-test

# 4. Run linting to check code quality (takes ~4 seconds)  
make lint
```

**NEVER CANCEL**: All build commands require patience. Docker builds can take 2+ minutes.

### Development Servers

Start development servers for active development:

```bash
# Backend server (runs on http://localhost:5000)
PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py

# Frontend server (runs on http://localhost:5174) - in separate terminal
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Docker Build and Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image (CURRENTLY FAILS - Dockerfile has syntax error on line 37)
# docker build -t landscape-architecture-tool .  # DO NOT USE - BROKEN

# Run with Docker Compose (includes PostgreSQL and Redis)
docker compose up --build  # Note: use 'docker compose' (with space), not 'docker-compose'
```

**KNOWN ISSUE**: The Dockerfile currently has a syntax error in a multi-line Python RUN command. Docker builds will fail until this is fixed.

## Testing and Validation

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Run all backend tests (493 tests, takes ~50 seconds)
make backend-test

# Expected results: ~174-179 tests pass, ~5 tests may fail due to test data isolation
# Core functionality works despite some test failures

# Run specific test file
PYTHONPATH=. FLASK_ENV=testing python -m pytest tests/test_basic.py -v

# Run with coverage
PYTHONPATH=. FLASK_ENV=testing python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Frontend has mixed Jest/Vitest setup - use vitest for better compatibility
cd frontend && npm run test:vitest:run

# Expected results: ~45/47 tests pass, ~2 tests may fail due to timeout/accessibility issues
# Takes ~8 seconds to complete

# For watch mode during development
cd frontend && npm run test:vitest:watch

# Note: Some tests have timeout and accessibility issues documented as known issues
```

### Full Application Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint (should return JSON with status)
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/api/suppliers

# Test frontend accessibility  
curl http://localhost:5174/
```

## Code Quality and Validation

### Pre-commit and Code Quality
```bash
# Format and validate code (takes ~4 seconds)
make lint

# Use Copilot workflow helper for comprehensive validation
python scripts/copilot_workflow.py --all

# Check pipeline health status
python scripts/pipeline_health_monitor.py
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Run database migrations
PYTHONPATH=. flask --app src.main db upgrade

# Check migration status
PYTHONPATH=. flask --app src.main db current

# Create new migration (if needed)
PYTHONPATH=. flask --app src.main db migrate -m "Description"
```

## Validation Scenarios

**ALWAYS test these scenarios after making changes:**

### 1. Basic Application Functionality
```bash
# Start backend server
PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py

# In separate terminal, test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Expected: JSON response with "status": "healthy" and database status

# Test API functionality
curl http://localhost:5000/api/suppliers
# Expected: JSON response with suppliers list (should show 3-4 suppliers)

# Test dashboard statistics
curl http://localhost:5000/api/dashboard/stats
# Expected: JSON with supplier, plant, and project counts
```

### 2. Frontend Integration Testing
```bash
# Start both servers and test integration
# Backend: PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py (port 5000)
# Frontend: cd frontend && npm run dev (port 5174)

# Test frontend loads
curl http://localhost:5174/
# Expected: HTML response with React application

# Manual browser testing:
# - Navigate to http://localhost:5174/
# - Verify dashboard loads with charts and statistics
# - Test navigation to http://localhost:5174/suppliers
# - Verify suppliers page shows data and CRUD functionality
```

### 3. CRUD Operations Testing
```bash
# Test creating new supplier
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/suppliers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Supplier", "contact_person": "Test Person", 
       "email": "test@example.com", "phone": "123-456-7890", 
       "address": "Test Address", "city": "Test City", 
       "postal_code": "12345", "country": "Netherlands"}'

# Verify supplier count increased
curl http://localhost:5000/api/suppliers | grep -o '"suppliers":\[.*\]' | grep -o '}' | wc -l
# Expected: Count should increase by 1
```

### 4. End-to-End Application Testing
```bash
# Complete application workflow test:
# 1. Start both servers
# 2. Open browser to http://localhost:5174/
# 3. Verify dashboard displays with Dutch text and working charts
# 4. Navigate to Suppliers page
# 5. Verify supplier data displays correctly
# 6. Test "Add Supplier" button functionality
# 7. Navigate to other pages (Plants, Projects, etc.)
# 8. Verify no JavaScript console errors
```

### 5. Development Workflow Validation
```bash
# Test complete development workflow
make clean && make install && make build && make backend-test && make lint
# Expected: All commands complete successfully with acceptable results

# Test database operations
PYTHONPATH=. flask --app src.main db current
# Expected: No errors, shows current migration status

# Test health monitoring
python scripts/pipeline_health_monitor.py
# Expected: Generates health report with status overview
```

## Common Development Tasks

### Add New Feature
1. **Always run tests first**: `make backend-test` to ensure current state
2. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Develop with validation**: Make changes, run `make lint` frequently
4. **Test thoroughly**: Run validation scenarios from this guide
5. **Pre-commit validation**: `python scripts/copilot_workflow.py --all`

### Fix Bug
1. **Reproduce issue**: Use validation scenarios to confirm bug
2. **Write test**: Add test that reproduces the bug in appropriate test file
3. **Fix issue**: Make minimal changes to resolve the bug
4. **Validate fix**: Run `make backend-test` and `make lint`
5. **Test manually**: Use validation scenarios to confirm fix

### Update Dependencies
1. **Check current state**: `make backend-test` to baseline
2. **Update requirements**: Modify `requirements.in` or `requirements-dev.in`
3. **Compile requirements**: `./scripts/compile_requirements.sh`
4. **Test changes**: `make install && make backend-test`
5. **Validate**: Ensure all tests still pass

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Failures:**
- Run `make clean` to clear build artifacts
- Check `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` for dependency issues
- Verify Node.js version compatibility for frontend

**Test Failures:**
- Database issues: Check if SQLite is accessible for tests
- Import errors: Verify `PYTHONPATH=.` is set for test runs
- Frontend test issues: Known Jest/Vitest compatibility - use vitest when possible

**Frontend Issues:**
- Module resolution: Check `import.meta.env` usage in `src/services/api.js`
- Build issues: Clear `node_modules` and reinstall with `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`

**Docker Issues:**
- **Dockerfile syntax error**: Current Dockerfile fails on line 37 due to malformed multi-line Python RUN command
- **Command change**: Use `docker compose` (with space) instead of `docker-compose`
- Port conflicts: Ensure ports 5000 (backend) and 5174 (frontend) are available

### Emergency Commands
```bash
# Reset development environment
make clean && make install

# Bypass pre-commit checks (emergency only)
git commit --no-verify

# Skip environment validation
export SKIP_ENV_CHECK=1

# Health check
python scripts/pipeline_health_monitor.py
```
