# This workflow warns and then closes issues and PRs that have had no activity for a specified amount of time.
#
# Stale Policy:
# - Issues and PRs are marked stale after 60 days of inactivity
# - Stale items are closed after 7 additional days of inactivity
# - Items with 'pinned', 'security', or 'never-stale' labels are exempt
#
# You can adjust the behavior by modifying this file.
