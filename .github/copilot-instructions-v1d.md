# Landscape Architecture Tool - V1.00D Development Instructions

**CRITICAL: V1.00D BRANCH PROTECTION AND FEATURE ISOLATION**

This is the **V1.00D development branch** with complete environment isolation and automated devdeploy deployment. Follow these enhanced instructions for safe development.

## 🛡️ BRANCH PROTECTION RULES

### ❌ MAIN BRANCH - PROTECTED
- **NO direct commits allowed** - Main branch is production-protected
- **NO workflow modifications** without promotion process
- **NO experimental features** or breaking changes
- **ONLY promoted changes** via `./scripts/deployment/promote_v1d_to_v1.sh`

### ✅ V1.00D BRANCH - SAFE DEVELOPMENT ZONE
- **All development work** happens on V1.00D branch
- **Automatic devdeploy deployment** on every push
- **Complete isolation** from production environment
- **Safe experimentation** with full rollback capabilities

## 🎯 V1.00D ENVIRONMENT ISOLATION

### Development Environment (V1.00D)
```bash
URL: http://72.60.176.200:8080
Title: "devdeploy - Landscape Architecture Tool (Development)"
Backend Port: 5001
Database: development.db
Service: landscape-backend-dev
Environment: Completely isolated from production
```

### Production Environment (V1.00 - PROTECTED)
```bash

## 🚀 SAFE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### 1. Feature Development Pattern
```bash
# Always start from V1.00D
git checkout V1.00D
git pull origin V1.00D

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Ensure devdeploy title (automatic)
./scripts/development/ensure_devdeploy_title.sh

# Make changes safely
# ... your development work ...

# Test in isolated environment
./scripts/deployment/deploy_v1d_to_devdeploy.sh

# Verify isolation maintained
curl -s https://optura.nl | grep "<title>"  # Should be unchanged
curl -s http://72.60.176.200:8080 | grep "devdeploy"  # Should show devdeploy

# Merge back to V1.00D when ready
git checkout V1.00D
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin V1.00D  # Triggers automatic devdeploy deployment
```

### 2. Breaking Change Prevention
```bash
# Before any major change
./scripts/maintenance/backup.sh

# Test changes thoroughly
./scripts/testing/automated_validation.py

# Verify environment isolation
echo "Production should be unchanged:"
curl -s https://optura.nl/health | head -2

echo "Development should show your changes:"
curl -s http://72.60.176.200:8080/health | head -2
```

### 3. Promotion to Production (When Ready)
```bash
# Only when V1.00D is stable and tested
./scripts/deployment/promote_v1d_to_v1.sh

# This safely promotes to V1.00 package without touching production
# Separate deployment step required for production update
```

## 🔧 ENHANCED BUILD AND TEST PROCESS

### V1.00D Specific Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies (V1.00D compatible)
make install

# Build with devdeploy branding
make build
# Automatically ensures "devdeploy" title in frontend

# Test in isolated environment
make backend-test  # Uses development database
cd frontend && npm run test:run  # Isolated frontend tests

# Deploy to devdeploy environment
./scripts/deployment/deploy_v1d_to_devdeploy.sh
```

### Automatic DevDeploy Features
- **Title Enforcement**: Automatically sets "devdeploy" title
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate database and services
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic verification after deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatic deployment on V1.00D pushes

## 🔍 VALIDATION AND SAFETY CHECKS

### Environment Isolation Verification
```bash
# Verify production unchanged
curl -s https://optura.nl | grep "<title>"
# Expected: "Landscape Architecture Tool - Professional Garden Design Management"

# Verify development environment
curl -s http://72.60.176.200:8080 | grep "<title>"
# Expected: "devdeploy - Landscape Architecture Tool (Development)"

# Check backend isolation
curl -s https://optura.nl/api/health | jq '.status'      # Production
curl -s http://72.60.176.200:8080/health | jq '.status' # Development
```

### Pre-commit Safety Checks
```bash
# Automatic checks on V1.00D branch
./scripts/development/ensure_devdeploy_title.sh  # Title enforcement
./scripts/testing/automated_validation.py --quick  # Quick validation
```

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Production Accidentally Affected
```bash
# Check production status
curl -s https://optura.nl/health

# If issues detected, production has automatic backups
# Contact system administrator immediately
# V1.00D changes should NEVER affect production due to isolation
```

### Reset Development Environment
```bash
# Reset V1.00D to clean state
git checkout V1.00D
git reset --hard origin/V1.00D

# Redeploy clean environment
./scripts/deployment/deploy_v1d_to_devdeploy.sh
```

### Rollback V1.00D Changes
```bash
# Restore from backup
./scripts/maintenance/backup.sh --restore

# Or reset to previous commit
git checkout V1.00D
git reset --hard HEAD~1
./scripts/deployment/deploy_v1d_to_devdeploy.sh
```

## 🎯 FEATURE ISOLATION PATTERNS

### Safe Feature Development
```python
# Use feature flags for experimental features
from src.utils.feature_flags import feature_flags

@app.route('/api/experimental-feature')
def experimental_feature():
    if not feature_flags.is_enabled('experimental_feature'):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Feature not available'}), 404
    
    # Feature implementation only runs in development
    return jsonify({'status': 'experimental feature active'})
```

### Database Changes Safety
```python
# Always use safe migration patterns
def upgrade():
    # Use IF NOT EXISTS for safety
    op.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS new_feature (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            data TEXT
        )
    """)
    
    # Add columns safely
    try:
        op.add_column('table', sa.Column('new_col', sa.String(255), nullable=True))
    except Exception:
        pass  # Column might already exist
```
