# Data Ingestion & Tooling Guardrails (DT1)

> Reference the [MCP Agent Triage Map](README.md#quick-links) for cross-category workflow steps and required secondary guardrails.
> Confirm sub-workflow obligations in [subworkflows.md](subworkflows.md) before starting work.

1. Review the ingest route (`src/routes/excel_import.py`), supporting services, and existing fixtures before changing behavior.
2. Preserve data validation and sanitizationâ€”extend current checks instead of bypassing them. Pay special attention to duplicate detection and transaction handling.
3. Update tests and fixtures when accepted columns or formats change. Required commands:

   ```powershell
   python -m pytest tests/test_excel_import.py tests/fixtures/test_stability.py
   ```

4. Log format or workflow changes in `dev_log.md` and, if needed, update operator documentation under `docs/development/`.
5. Clean up temporary files and ensure large file uploads are handled efficiently (streaming or chunking where applicable).
