# VPS Access Test Report - After Firewall Reset

**Test Date**: October 2, 2025, 07:15 UTC  
**VPS IP**: 72.60.176.200  
**Test Source**: Dev Container (IP: TBD)  
**User Action**: Firewall settings RESET in Hostinger panel

---

## Test Results Summary

### Port Connectivity Tests
All ports tested with 8-second timeout:

| Port | Service | Status | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| 22   | SSH     | ‚ùå BLOCKED | Connection timeout |
| 5001 | Backend API | ‚ùå BLOCKED | Connection timeout |
| 8080 | Frontend/Nginx | ‚ùå BLOCKED | Connection timeout |

### HTTP Access Tests
Both HTTP endpoints timeout after 8 seconds:

- **Frontend** (http://72.60.176.200:8080/): ‚ùå BLOCKED - curl terminated
- **Backend** (http://72.60.176.200:5001/health): ‚ùå BLOCKED - curl terminated

### SSH Authentication Test
Direct SSH with password authentication:
```bash
sshpass -p 'Volisvol1988' ssh root@72.60.176.200
Result: ‚ùå Connection timed out (port 22 blocked)
```

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ COMPLETE ACCESS BLOCKAGE
After resetting firewall settings in Hostinger panel:
- **ALL ports remain blocked** (22, 5001, 8080)
- **No change from previous state** despite firewall reset
- **SSH port 22 still blocked** - Cannot access VPS remotely

### Pattern Analysis
The consistent timeout behavior (no "Connection refused") indicates:
1. Packets are being **dropped** before reaching the VPS
2. This is characteristic of a **cloud-level firewall** blocking traffic
3. VPS-level firewall (UFW/iptables) is likely not the issue

## What "Firewall Reset" Should Have Done

When you reset firewall settings in Hostinger, it should:
1. ‚úÖ Remove all custom firewall rules
2. ‚úÖ Return to **default allow state** OR
3. ‚úÖ Apply **minimal default rules** (typically allow 22, 80, 443)
4. ‚ùå Result: **Nothing changed** - all ports still blocked

---

## Possible Explanations

### 1. üî¥ Firewall Not Actually Reset
- Settings may show "reset" but not applied to VPS instance
- Requires manual "Apply" or "Sync" action
- May need VPS restart to take effect

### 2. üî¥ Multiple Firewall Layers
- Hostinger may have **two firewall systems**:
  - VPS Firewall (what you reset)
  - Network/Infrastructure Firewall (managed separately)
- One layer may still be blocking despite reset

### 3. üî¥ DDoS Protection Active
- Hostinger may have activated DDoS protection
- Your IP range may be temporarily blocked
- Protection settings separate from firewall

### 4. üî¥ VPS Network Isolation
- VPS may be in "maintenance mode" or "isolated network"
- Network interface not properly configured
- Missing default route or DNS

---

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE - Verify Firewall Reset

1. **Check Hostinger Panel - VPS Firewall Tab**
   ```
   ‚òê Verify firewall shows "No rules" or "Default"
   ‚òê Check if there's a pending "Sync" or "Apply" button
   ‚òê Look for "Status: Active" vs "Status: Inactive"
   ‚òê Verify VPS is listed under "Attached to"
   ```

2. **Check for Multiple Firewall Interfaces**
   ```
   ‚òê Look for "Network Firewall" vs "VPS Firewall"
   ‚òê Check "Security" or "Protection" tabs
   ‚òê Look for DDoS protection settings
   ```

### URGENT - Contact Hostinger Support

Since firewall reset did not resolve the issue, **immediate support contact is necessary**:

**Provide to support:**
- VPS IP: `72.60.176.200`
- Issue: "All ports blocked after firewall reset"
- Actions taken: "Reset firewall settings, restarted VPS"
- Current state: "Cannot access any ports including SSH (22)"
- Request: "Verify firewall is actually disabled/reset on my VPS"

**Key questions for support:**
1. "Is there a network-level firewall separate from VPS firewall?"
2. "Can you verify my VPS is not in DDoS protection mode?"
3. "Can you see any firewall rules active on my VPS from your end?"
4. "Do I need to explicitly disable/remove the firewall, not just reset it?"

### DIAGNOSTIC - GitHub Actions Test

I've created a comprehensive diagnostic workflow that can:
- Test connectivity from GitHub Actions (different IP range)
- SSH into VPS with root access to check internal firewall state
- Generate detailed system diagnostic report

**To trigger it:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/HANSKMIEL/landscape-architecture-tool/actions
2. Select "VPS Root Diagnostic" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "full" diagnostic type
5. Review output to see internal VPS state

## Technical Analysis

### Connection Behavior Indicates
```
Timeout (not "Connection refused") = Packets dropped at firewall
All ports blocked = Comprehensive firewall rule or network isolation
No difference after reset = Firewall not actually applied OR
                           Different firewall layer active
```

### Expected vs Actual

**Expected after firewall reset:**
- ‚úÖ Port 22 (SSH) should be accessible
- ‚úÖ At minimum, default ports should open
- ‚úÖ Some change in behavior

**Actual result:**
- ‚ùå All ports remain blocked
- ‚ùå No change in connectivity
- ‚ùå SSH still inaccessible

This indicates the firewall reset **did not take effect** on the actual VPS network.

## Next Steps

### For You (User)
1. **Take screenshots** of Hostinger panel showing:
   - Firewall settings after reset
   - VPS details page
   - Any "pending" or "sync required" messages
2. **Contact Hostinger support** with details above
3. **Try GitHub Actions diagnostic** workflow

### For Us (Technical)
1. Wait for GitHub Actions diagnostic results
2. Review Hostinger support response
3. Investigate alternative access methods if support can't help

## Previous Context

- **Backend binding issue**: ‚úÖ Fixed (0.0.0.0:5001 verified in logs)
- **Services running**: ‚úÖ Confirmed internally on VPS
- **Firewall rules created**: ‚ùå Did not take effect
- **SSH rule added**: ‚ùå Did not take effect
- **VPS restarted**: ‚ùå Did not help
- **Firewall reset**: ‚ùå Did not help

**Conclusion**: The problem is definitively at the **Hostinger cloud/network level**, not within the VPS itself.
