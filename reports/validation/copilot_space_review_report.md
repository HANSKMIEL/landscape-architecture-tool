## Detailed Validation Results

### ✅ Architecture Patterns Validation

#### Database Transaction Patterns
- **Status:** ✅ VALIDATED - Implementation matches documentation exactly
- **Location:** `tests/conftest.py` lines 115-125
- **Finding:** Enhanced SAVEPOINT-based transaction isolation is correctly implemented
- **Code Verification:**
  ```python
  # Actual implementation matches documented pattern
  if conn.in_transaction():
      outer_tx = conn.begin_nested()  # SAVEPOINT isolation
  else:
      outer_tx = conn.begin()         # Regular transaction
  ```

#### Service Layer Patterns  
- **Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Pattern exists but could be enhanced
