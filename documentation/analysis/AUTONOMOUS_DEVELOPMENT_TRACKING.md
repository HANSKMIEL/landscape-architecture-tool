2. **Rollback Ready**: Always have a rollback plan for automated changes
3. **Human Oversight**: Complex decisions require human confirmation
4. **Continuous Learning**: Improve processes based on outcomes
5. **Professional Context**: Remember this serves landscape architecture professionals

### Autonomous Decision Boundaries
**Can Execute Automatically:**
- Code formatting fixes (Black, isort)
- Documentation updates reflecting code changes
- Dependency security updates (after testing)
- Health monitoring and reporting
