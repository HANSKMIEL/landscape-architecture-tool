# Phase 2: Performance & Optimization Issues

**Phase Status**: Ready after Phase 1 completion  
**Total Issues**: 5 performance issues (05-09)  
**Estimated Effort**: 44-62 hours  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 must be completed first

## Phase 2 Issues Overview

### Issue 05: Caching Strategy (#258)
- **Effort**: 8-12 hours
- **Focus**: Enhanced Redis integration, intelligent caching for plant/supplier data
- **Dependencies**: Issue 02 (Architecture - requires dependency injection)

### Issue 06: Database Optimization (#259)  
- **Effort**: 10-14 hours
- **Focus**: Spatial indexes, composite indexes for landscape architecture queries
- **Dependencies**: Issue 03 (Error Handling - requires database error management)

### Issue 07: State Management (#260)
- **Effort**: 8-12 hours  
- **Focus**: Zustand/Redux Toolkit for plant catalogs, project data, user preferences
- **Dependencies**: Issue 04 (API Versioning - requires stable API structure)

### Issue 08: Component Architecture (#261)
- **Effort**: 8-12 hours
- **Focus**: Compound component pattern for landscape design interfaces
- **Dependencies**: Issues 01-04 (requires foundation stability)

### Issue 09: Performance Optimization (#262)
- **Effort**: 10-12 hours
- **Focus**: React.memo, useMemo for plant catalog and project visualization
- **Dependencies**: Issues 05-08 (requires all performance infrastructure)

## Implementation Sequence

```
Phase 1 Complete → 05 (Caching) → 06 (Database) → 07 (State) → 08 (Components) → 09 (Performance)
```

## Phase 2 Success Criteria

- [ ] Redis caching strategy implemented and tested
- [ ] Database optimization deployed with performance benchmarks  
- [ ] State management solution integrated across components
- [ ] Component architecture refactored for compound patterns
- [ ] Performance targets met for plant catalog and project visualization
- [ ] All Phase 2 tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented

## Key Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive Caching System**: Redis-based caching for landscape calculations
2. **Database Performance**: Optimized queries for location-based plant recommendations  
3. **Modern State Management**: Centralized state for complex landscape workflows
4. **Component Flexibility**: Reusable compound components for design tools
5. **Performance Optimization**: Measurable improvements in rendering and data processing

## Dependencies for Phase 3

Phase 2 completion enables:
- **Issue 10**: Accessibility (requires optimized components from Issue 08)
- **Issue 11**: GIS Integration (requires database optimization from Issue 06)
- **Issue 12**: Plant Database Enhancement (requires caching from Issue 05)
- **Issues 13-16**: Advanced features requiring performance foundation
