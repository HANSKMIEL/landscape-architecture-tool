   ```

   **Option C: Manual Setup**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   export PYTHONPATH=.
   python src/main.py

   # Frontend (new terminal)
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

**Python (Backend)**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use `black` for code formatting
- Use `isort` for import sorting
- Use `ruff` for linting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters

**JavaScript (Frontend)**
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Use meaningful variable names
- Prefer functional components with hooks

```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# All tests with coverage
make test
```

### Test Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All new functions and methods should have unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints should have integration tests
- **Frontend Tests**: Components should have React Testing Library tests
- **Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage

### Writing Tests

**Backend Example:**
```python
def test_create_supplier():
    """Test supplier creation with valid data."""
    supplier_data = {
        "name": "Test Supplier",
        "contact_email": "test@example.com"
    }
    response = client.post("/api/suppliers", json=supplier_data)
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json["name"] == "Test Supplier"
```

**Frontend Example:**
```javascript
test('renders supplier list', async () => {
  render(<SupplierList />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Suppliers')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
