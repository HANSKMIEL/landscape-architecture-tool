# ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED: Branch Migration to Complete

## Status: Manual GitHub Operations Needed

This PR prepares the repository for a branch migration where:
- **V1.00D** will become **main**
- Current **main** will become **Archive-main**

### üö® What You Need to Do

**Repository administrators must perform these manual steps via GitHub web interface:**

1. **Read the detailed instructions**: [GitHub Branch Rename Instructions](docs/GITHUB_BRANCH_RENAME_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

2. **Execute the branch rename operations** (GitHub Settings ‚Üí Branches):
   - Rename `main` ‚Üí `Archive-main`
   - Rename `V1.00D` ‚Üí `main`
   - Set `main` as the default branch

3. **Notify team members** to update their local repositories

4. **Merge this PR** - This can be done before, during, or after the rename since the workflows are designed to work with both branch names during the transition

### üìö Documentation

- **[Branch Migration Guide](docs/BRANCH_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide for all stakeholders
- **[GitHub Branch Rename Instructions](docs/GITHUB_BRANCH_RENAME_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Step-by-step manual operations

### ‚úÖ What This PR Does

This PR makes the codebase **forward-compatible** with the branch rename:

- ‚úÖ Updated all CI/CD workflows to trigger on both `main` and `V1.00D`
- ‚úÖ Added migration notices to documentation
- ‚úÖ Updated copilot instructions
- ‚úÖ Updated README with migration information
- ‚úÖ Updated deployment scripts with transition notes

### üéØ Why This Change?

**Current Reality:**
- V1.00D is the active development branch
- V1.00D is deployed to VPS (http://72.60.176.200:8080)
- Main branch is no longer actively used

**Desired State:**
- Make the naming match reality: `main` = active development
- Archive the old production state for historical reference
- Simplify the workflow (no more dual-branch promotion)

### üìã Post-Merge Actions

After the GitHub rename and this PR is merged:

1. All team members update local repos (see Migration Guide)
2. Verify CI/CD pipelines work correctly
3. Monitor VPS deployment continues smoothly
4. Close out migration documentation
